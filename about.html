    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <h3> Hi</h3>
    <p>
        I'm Enoch, a passionate User Experience and Interaction Design student at Drexel University.
        My journey in design started with a love for creativity and problem-solving. 
        I’ve always been fascinated by how we interact with everyday tools, apps, 
        and devices which led me to pursue design that focuses not just on aesthetics, 
        but on making experiences better for people.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before Drexel, I studied Interaction Design with a minor in Advertising Practices at 
        the University of the Arts until its closure. I graduated from the Community College 
        of Philadelphia in 2023, where I studied Art and Design with a concentration in Graphic Design. 
        This diverse background in both visual design and user interaction gives me a unique 
        edge in understanding how to blend visually appealing graphics and 
        functionality to solve user problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm always looking for new inspiration to fuel my creativity. 
        When I’m not designing, I immerse myself in different creative outlets of art 
        in any form or medium, work out, or spend quality time with family and friends.
    </p>
